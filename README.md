     A smart web application that recommends outfits based on real-time weather conditions using weather APIs and intelligent outfit logic.

🔁 How It Works<br>
User visits the app.

The app fetches the current weather data based on the user's location.

Logic or ML model analyzes the weather data.

Recommended outfits are displayed (e.g., “Wear a hoodie and jeans — it’s cloudy and 15°C”).
